# task1
Write an application that reverses all the words of input text:

  E.g. "abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe"

All non-letter symbols should stay on the same places:

  E.g. "a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e"

Use Latin alphabet for test only.

Hint:

1. Start with the implementation of a method that reverses only 1 word at a time.

2. (Optional) Add Main (Application) class where you can read console input or hardcode it to check yourself.

3. Add a method that splits the string into words and runs the previous method for each word
